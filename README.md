# Tetris C# #
<https://github.com/timdetering/Tetris-CSharp>

A Tetris game clone developed quickly as a WinForms application.

Allows custom blocksets. These are stored in files with a .blockset extension in the same directory as the application is being run from.
Blocks must be square, with an even length side.
Solid parts of a block are specified by a hash (#), while a blank may be any other character.
There must be at least 1 blank line between two blocks.
There must be at least 2 blank lines at the end of the file.
